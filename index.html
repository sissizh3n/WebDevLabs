                But you knew that you wanted to take her home You saw her alone there 
                against the sky It was like she's someone you'd always known It was like 
                you were holding the world when you held her Like yours were the arms that
                the whole world was in And there were no words for the way that you felt 
                So you opened your mouth and you started to sing</p>
